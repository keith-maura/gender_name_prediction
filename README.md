# Gender Name Prediction

## Motivation
The purpose of this project was to determine if gender can viably be predicted from a name itself. Such models that we built are effective in predicting male or female names, but are least effective against names that are “neutral”, that is, names that can be assigned to either gender. Simple models drawing upon manual feature engineering rely the most on the last letter of a name, whereas our neural network model drew upon the order of letters.
